# Privacy Policy for Privacy Guard Extension

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

Privacy Guard ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Privacy Guard Chrome extension handles information.

## Data Collection

### What We Don't Collect

Privacy Guard is designed with privacy as a core principle. We **do NOT** collect:

- ❌ URLs you visit
- ❌ Content of pages you analyze
- ❌ Personal information
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ API keys or credentials
- ❌ Any data that leaves your device (unless you explicitly use AI analysis)

### What We Store Locally

The extension stores data locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API:

- ✅ Analysis results (cached for 6 hours)
- ✅ Your API keys (if you configure them)
- ✅ Extension settings and preferences
- ✅ Analysis history (optional, can be cleared)

**All data stays on your device** and is never transmitted to us or any third party (except the API provider you choose for AI analysis).

## AI Analysis

When you use AI-powered analysis:

1. **Text is sent to your chosen API provider** (Deepseek, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini)
2. **Only the page text is sent** - no URLs, personal info, or metadata
3. **API keys are stored locally** and sent only to authenticate with the provider
4. **You control which provider** to use (or use local mode for no API calls)

### API Provider Privacy

Each API provider has its own privacy policy:
- [Deepseek Privacy Policy](https://platform.deepseek.com/privacy)
- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## Local Analysis Mode

When using Local/Hybrid mode:
- ✅ **No data leaves your device**
- ✅ Analysis runs entirely in your browser
- ✅ Uses keyword matching and heuristics
- ✅ Completely private

## Third-Party Services

Privacy Guard does not use:
- ❌ Analytics services
- ❌ Tracking pixels
- ❌ Advertising networks
- ❌ Third-party data brokers

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or rent your data to anyone. Ever.

## Data Retention

- **Cached analyses**: 6 hours (automatically deleted)
- **Settings**: Stored until you uninstall the extension
- **History**: Stored until you clear it manually

## Your Rights

You have full control:

- ✅ Clear cache at any time
- ✅ Clear history at any time
- ✅ Export your data
- ✅ Uninstall the extension (removes all data)
- ✅ Use local-only mode (no API calls)

## Children's Privacy

Privacy Guard is not intended for users under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
